# Google Sheets Integration Guide

This guide will help you automatically save signup data to Google Sheets.

## Is it Free? ðŸ’°

**YES! It's 100% FREE!** Google Sheets API is completely free for normal usage (up to 60 requests per minute per user, which is more than enough for most applications).

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click on "Select a Project" at the top
3. Click "NEW PROJECT"
4. Enter project name (e.g., "Abcd Backend")
5. Click "CREATE"

### Step 2: Enable Google Sheets API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, make sure your new project is selected
2. Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library" (from the left sidebar)
3. Search for "Google Sheets API"
4. Click on "Google Sheets API"
5. Click "ENABLE"

### Step 3: Create Service Account

1. Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"
2. Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS" â†’ "Service account"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Service account name**: `abcd-sheet-service`
   - **Service account ID**: (auto-generated)
   - **Description**: `Service account for saving signup data to Google Sheets`
4. Click "CREATE AND CONTINUE"
5. Skip the optional steps by clicking "DONE"

### Step 4: Create and Download Service Account Key (IMPORTANT!)

1. On the "Credentials" page, you'll see your service account listed under "Service Accounts"
2. Click on the service account email (e.g., `abcd-sheet-service@...`)
3. Go to the "KEYS" tab
4. Click "ADD KEY" â†’ "Create new key"
5. Select "JSON" format
6. Click "CREATE"
7. A JSON file will be downloaded to your computer
8. **IMPORTANT**: Rename this file to `google-credentials.json`

### Step 5: Share This File With Me

**What to share with me:**

1. The downloaded `google-credentials.json` file content
   - Open the file in a text editor
   - Copy the entire content
   - Share it with me (I'll add it to your project securely)

2. Your Google Sheet URL or ID
   - If you already have a sheet, share the URL
   - OR I can help you create a new sheet

---

## Step 6: Create Google Sheet (If you don't have one)

### Option A: Create New Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Click "Blank" to create a new sheet
3. Name it (e.g., "Abcd Signups")
4. Add column headers in the first row:
   - `Full Name` | `Email` | `Mobile` | `Father Name` | `Address` | `Gotra` | `City` | `UTR Number` | `Registration Date` | `Status`

### Option B: Use Existing Sheet

If you already have a Google Sheet, just share the URL with me.

### Step 7: Share Sheet with Service Account

**CRITICAL STEP!**

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Click the "Share" button (top right)
3. In the service account JSON file, find the `client_email` field
   - It looks like: `abcd-sheet-service@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Copy that email address
5. Paste it in the "Add people and groups" field in Google Sheets
6. Give it "Editor" access
7. Click "Send"

**Without this step, the bot won't be able to write to your sheet!**

## What I Need From You

To implement this for you, please provide:

### 1. Google Service Account Credentials
```
Share the content of google-credentials.json file
(It's safe to share with me - I'll add it securely to your project)
```

### 2. Google Sheet Information

**Option A:** Share your existing Google Sheet URL
```
Example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j/edit
```

**Option B:** Tell me you want to create a new sheet and I'll guide you

### 3. What data to save? (Current signup fields I see)

From your signup form, I'll save:
- âœ… Full Name
- âœ… Email (if provided)
- âœ… Mobile
- âœ… Father Name
- âœ… Address
- âœ… Gotra
- âœ… City (if provided)
- âœ… UTR Number (if provided)
- âœ… Registration Date & Time
- âœ… Payment Screenshot URL (if uploaded)
- âœ… Passport Photo URL
- âœ… Verification Status (default: "Pending")

**Do you want to save all of these fields, or only specific ones?**

## Security Notes

### Where to put the credentials file?

I will:
1. Save `google-credentials.json` in the `backend/` folder
2. Add it to `.gitignore` so it's never committed to Git
3. Add the Sheet ID to your `.env` file

### .env file will have:
```env
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_sheet_id_here
```

---

## After Implementation

Once implemented, every time someone signs up:
1. User data is saved to MongoDB âœ…
2. User data is automatically saved to Google Sheets âœ…
3. You get a Telegram notification âœ…

You'll have a live spreadsheet tracking all signups in real-time!

## FAQ

**Q: Is this secure?**
A: Yes! Service account credentials are secure and meant for backend services. Just don't commit the JSON file to Git (I'll add it to .gitignore).

**Q: Can I edit the sheet manually?**
A: Yes! You can edit, add columns, format cells, etc. The bot will just append new rows.

**Q: What if Google Sheets is down?**
A: Data still saves to MongoDB. Google Sheets is just a backup/convenience.

**Q: Can I use the same service account for multiple sheets?**
A: Yes! Just share each sheet with the service account email.

**Q: Rate limits?**
A: Free tier allows 60 requests/minute per user. More than enough for most apps.

## What to do next?

**Please provide:**

1. âœ… Content of `google-credentials.json` file (the downloaded JSON)
2. âœ… Google Sheet URL (or tell me to create one)
3. âœ… Confirm which fields you want to save

Once you share these, I'll implement it in about 2 minutes!
